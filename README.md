### Welcome

This is the source repository that accompanies my [The Big Testing Course]().

In this repository you will find source materials as to how you can use different testing frameworks.

List of frameworks:
- [doctest](/D/README.md)
- [locust](/L/README.md)
- [pytest](/P/README.md)
- [nose2](/N/README.md)
- [splinter](/S/README.md)

This list is to be extended or further refined.
